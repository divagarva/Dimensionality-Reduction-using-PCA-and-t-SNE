# Dimensionality-Reduction-using-PCA-and-t-SNE
 This Python project demonstrates dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). It reduces high-dimensional data to 2D, visualizing patterns and structures for easier interpretation, using the Iris dataset as an example.
